## Where this started
In 2017 I had the idea to create a new game inspired by elements from some of the more strategic, collectible card games that I have enjoyed in the past. The primary difference with our game is that anyone can **play it for free**. The game is **absent of the "pay to win" strategies** that similar games intentionally design. I believe that this game can be simple and **easy to approach** while still offering a **high level of strategic elements** to make it fun for anyone. The best part is that the entire game is designed around a **single deck of standard playing cards**.

My sons and I have been developing and play testing this game since its inception. I believe we are very close to sharing it with the world. Our vision is that friends and family can grab any old deck of playing cards and enjoy a quick game, either at home, camping, on a road trip, etcâ€¦

We originally titled this game "Cards of War"

## Cards of War!

    War is upon us! The kingdoms are divided and the land is in turmoil. Bring stability to the people by defeating the opposition to rule supremely over all. To do this, you must recruit forces from the four royal houses; the quick Diamonds, brutal Clubs, vigilant Hearts and cunning Spades. Cards of War is a game of luck as well as strategy. Each turn a random member of the four houses is drawn from the shared deck and chooses to fight by your side. Who will come to your aid? Will you be victorious?

I will admit the concept and introduction is a little cheesy, but that was the intention. It is supposed to have an easy to understand concept on the surface with layers of storytelling and complexity underneath for anyone who might enjoy that. The intent is that anyone should be able to understand and enjoy playing this game.

## Beyond that first game
We have since expanded beyond "Cards of War" to the concept of Houses as a collection of games. Cards of War itself, has now been retitled to **"Houses - Skirmish"** to make room for the other games, however this game remains a favorite for many reasons.
