Maybe the sun gets brighter as the card box is opened, and that triggers the events leading up to the war? In fact the \u201cancient ruler\u201d I envisioned in the Hearts backstory, was a player who previously won the game. That player was the victor who defeated their opponents and brought stability back to the broken land. They brought everyone together and placed them back into the card box, beginning a time of peace. To the people of this world, it may feel like eternity between game sessions.

Perhaps the King\u2019s presence on the battlefield will force opponents to consider the risks of using their current strategy or adopting another mid-game. So we are currently testing the following abilities of the Kings:</p> <p></p> <p>With the above change, each King will allow units from another house to share their unique house trait.

For example: The 9 of Spades may aid an allied 7 of Diamonds when they are both defending by adding 4 (half of 9 rounded down) to the 7\u2019s attack value.</p> <p>Though the above change fits thematically and strategically, it may be too complicated? </p>"},{"location":"The%20Games/Skirmish/#the-spades-house-traits","title":"The Spades' House Traits","text":"<p>From our play testing we have observed that the ability for the Spades to strike an adjacent opposing unit with their house trait, is rarely ever utilized.

At that time this house trait did fit thematically and strategically. However in today\u2019s version of the game, where pinging an adjacent opposing card with an additional strike, is not very useful. For this reason we are also considering the following potential change to the Spade\u2019s house trait.</p> <p></p> <p>With the above changes, the Spades would be able to chose their blocker if the opponent chooses to block their attack.

This places more significance on the fact that all of the Royal and specialty cards actually enter the battlefield (via the Rear Ranks) and must take their actions alongside the deployment of Front Rank cards. As all cards must enter the Battlefield in some fashion during the deployment phase, they therefore become vulnerable to responding actions from the opponent, such as assassination.</p> <p>The DEPLOY phase starts with the current player deploying all cards/units and then allowing a pause for the opponent\u2019s RESPONSE before the start of the COMBAT phase.

Other times it may be important to know what you opponent is preparing to do. In response to this, we have introduced scouts into the game.</p> <p>With this new version of the game, we will be introducing a new special ability for the 2 card in each suit. The core concept is that a player may choose to deploy their 2 card (of any suit) as a \u201cscout\u201d to seek information about the opponent\u2019s hand. If this gains no strategic advantage at the time, they may simply deploy the 2 as a simple soldier unit to the Front Ranks instead. If the 2 is used as a scout they are typically discarded to the Barrows following the conclusion of their scouting mission. Each suit\u2019s 2 accomplishes this in a different fashion to be explained in the flavor text in relation to their House\u2019s theme.

Scouting the opponent\u2019s position and abilities is just as strategically important as assassinating or eliminating key targets. The 2 card seemed to have very little strategic value in the front ranks as it only serves as a potential blocker. For example it could not be Blood Bonded with a 10 (for 12 Attack) and threaten the King with 13 Defense. The 3 of each suit can however, and so it has much more offensive value than the 2. </p>"},{"location":"The%20Games/Skirmish/#jack-of-clubs","title":"Jack of Clubs","text":"<p>The Jack of Clubs currently removes a random card from an opponent\u2019s hand and has it discarded.

This stirs an allied unit into a frenzied charge, fighting with greater skill and aggression.</p> <p>A single unit deals double damage for the current turn only.</p> <p>With the introduction of the scouts (Clubs and Spades), removing cards from the opponent\u2019s hand is now similarly accomplished in a different way. Randomly removing a card from a player\u2019s hand feels more like a Spades move. In the spirit of the Clubs delivering devastating damage, that may even spill over onto the opponent with their House Trait, it feels fitting that they gain a single turn surge of damage. This would only apply to a single unit\u2019s attack value as enhancing the entire Front Ranks might be overpowered. Also\u2026it is still funny to see the Jack meet an awkward or comical fate that ultimately benefits their army for a single turn.</p> <p>The threat of boosting the attack damage of a single unit that may be blocking or attacking could add many more layers of strategy to the game. </p>"},{"location":"The%20Games/Skirmish/#new-joker-variants","title":"New Joker Variants","text":"<p>The Black Joker is currently identified as the Doppelganger, which is creature that can mimic any other card the Player wishes. A new optional variant of the Black Joker will be a Necromancer who can resurrect a single defeated card from the Barrows each round.</p> <p>The Black Joker is an ancient necromancer (+0/+14) who brings promises of an endless army. Upon entering the battlefield, the necromancer may summon a Front Ranks unit (2-10) from the barrows that can act immediately. At the beginning of the next turn, the unit disappears and is placed face down next to the barrows, where it is no longer accessible for summoning.

This ability plays well in our test games as well. If a player decides to deploy this King, they tend to lean into a more aggressive play style to fully utilize this ability. However if they are not careful they might over extend and open themselves for devastating counter attacks. This King\u2019s abilities are not too strong and they fit thematically.</p> <p>The Kings of Clubs \u2013 The current rules allow this King to force any opposing soldier to step out and fight them. This challenge cannot be blocked or ignored. The end result is that the King just picks fights that they can win and simply eliminates a soldier unit each turn. This has the effect of an assassination each turn and gives the Player who deploys the King of Clubs too much control over the Battlefield. The funny thing here is that we have been trying to scale the King of Clubs since the inception of this game. It is tricky to provide a dominating force that fits thematically and doesn\u2019t break the game.</p> <p>Currently we are considering having the King of Clubs\u2019 presence on the Battlefield allowing the Player\u2019s Front Rank units the option to target the opposing Front Ranks units. This would be a significant advantage as the opposing player would lose the ability to choose who blocks each turn. Thematically the King might be inducing a sense of panic and fear for the opposing soldier units. Perhaps an army in disarray is less disciplined and attacking units may take advantage by catching them out of formation?</p> <p>The King of Hearts \u2013 Similar to the King of Clubs, the King of Hearts has been trouble for us from the beginning. Back in the earliest revision of the game, we were tracking health on each unit and the Hearts were supposed to provide healing support. Additionally the King of Hearts was originally designed to provide some direct balance to the King of Clubs. The current ruleset allows the King of Hearts to absorb up to 13 point of damage that would be dealt to an allied soldier unit of choice. If 13 (or more) points of damage is absorbed in this way, then the King will be defeated.</p> <p>This design is not necessarily \u201cbroken\u201d as the King risks themselves to protect allied units. However it can still be annoying for opponents to deal with, until they can deliver 13 (or more) points. The strategic value of this King depends on how early the Player is able to deploy them. From a thematic perspective this design is not really a problem either (as this still balances the King of Clubs) however it still feels\u2026 not quite right. We are continuing to look at this and perhaps this only needs a slight tweaking?</p> <p>We have discussed a few potential changes for the King of Hearts. The first option is having the King presence on the field provide a magical sense of \u201cawareness\u201d, thus providing the Hearts trait to all other soldiers under the player\u2019s control. This means everyone (all soldiers from any house) in the player\u2019s army would remain available to block after attacking. This might be too overpowered? However it fits better thematically as the Hearts are supposed to be more \u201cVigilant\u201d and \u201cMystical\u201d in design. An alternative option would be letting the King allow the Front Rank units to pick (or reassign) their blockers. This last option is similar to the proposed option for the King of Clubs above, however instead of targeting the opposing Front Ranks units, allies of the King of Hearts may (magically?) shift their formation after blockers have been assigned. This would allow them to counter or deny the opponent\u2019s choice for blocking. This may be the option that works better? However we likely need further play testing with these options before we lock in on the King of Hearts for the next version.</p> <p>The King of Spades \u2013 Oh\u2026 the King of Spades\u2026 You are truly the broken card. The King of Clubs only thinks they are the serious threat, however we have come to learn the truth. To understand the problem we have with this card, we have to look back at earliest design of this game. </p> <p>Here was our starting point back in 2017, scribed onto a sticky note..</p> <p></p> <p>The Spades are supposed to be cunning in design, and by that we mean \u201ctricky\u201d. Their advantage comes from being able to fool and misdirect their opponent. We landed on the ability to prevent units from being blocked or attacked early on. It felt sneaky and cunning enough and it has not changed since inception. I think in playing the earlier versions of the game, this advantage did not stand out as a big deal. The combat and targeting rules have changed a little over time however and now this appears to be very overpowered. In the current version of the game, the opponent (when being attacked) only has a few options to control the outcomes. They have very few cards to play in response (Jacks, etc..) as well as having the ability to choose who blocks the attackers. We see now that, by removing the ability to assign blockers, the opponent is essentially helpless.</p> <p>This last summer we were able to put this game through lots of testing. We were recording the win conditions and cards in play from each game. In nearly every game where the King of Spades was brought into play, the controller of that card would win the game. In fact one of our play testing scenarios involves splitting the deck into the four suites, removing the Jokers and pitting random suites against each other. Essentially each player pulls from a draw pile containing only cards of their house. Long story short, the Spades won every time. Most of the time this was directly attributed to the King being in play and preventing the opponent from doing anything. So\u2026yeah we know we have a problem here. So what to do? We need to adjust this while staying thematically accurate, and the King still needs to bring the sneak without the total dominance.</p> <p>One option that we are considering is having the King of Spades provide the house trait of striking twice to all allied soldier units. Of course the second strike is only an option if they defeat their blocker. This was similar to the solution that was proposed to the King of Hearts above. The formula is to just impart the house trait onto the other, non-spades units. Unfortunately in play testing this proved to be a little bit over powered and provided the Player with too much Battlefield dominance. So we scaled it back by designing the second strike to only \u201cstun\u201d the opposing units. Rather than killing them, this would just lock them down for a whole turn. This was less devastating, but still pretty powerful.</p> <p>We do like the mechanic of stunning opposing Front Rank units, and essentially preventing them from attacking the next round. Early on in the game\u2019s development we identified the Diamond and Clubs houses as having more offensive strategies and the Hearts and Spades being more defensive in nature. Stun locking your opponent or blocking their potential damage are both pretty solid \u201cdefensive\u201d strategies. I think we will be making an adjustment to the King of Spades in next version of the game. There may be other alternatives that we can explore here as well. As always, more play testing is needed.</p>"},{"location":"The%20Games/Skirmish/#kings-that-enhance-house-traits-option-2","title":"Kings that enhance House Traits (Option 2)","text":"<p>As we were exploring options to \u201cfix\u201d the Kings, we found ourselves discussing the ability for a King to impart their house\u2019s traits to allies from other houses. In a sense they are accepting this individual from another house to join them in battle. You might say they are adopting them into their house for the war and it would not be a stretch to say they would share their family\u2019s strategic secrets or magical enhancements. So.. we borrowed from some of the \u201coptions\u201d above and laid out how this might work.</p> <p>King of Diamonds \u2013 The King shares a secret tactic with all allied soldier units, so that when attacking they may strike and deal damage before the opponent can. Additionally, all allied soldiers that are originally from the House of Diamonds, may also perform this action when blocking. If two opposing units are attempting to employ this technique at the same time against each other, then this is canceled out.</p> <p>King of Clubs \u2013 The King\u2019s brutal nature encourages all allied soldier to throw themselves fully into every attack, and therefore deal all remaining damage (after combat) to the opposing player. Additionally all allied soldier that are originally from the House of Clubs, may also choose to do this after blocking an attacker.</p> <p>King of Hearts \u2013 The King casts a powerful spell that grant all allied soldiers the strength to remain available to defend as a blocker after attacking. Additionally all allied soldier units that are originally from the House of Hearts have the alertness to anticipate the opposing unit\u2019s strategy and shift to the blocker of their choice before combat ends. Units who perform this maneuver must trade blockers with another allied unit.</p> <p>King of Spades \u2013 The King provides all allied units with enchanted weaponry that vibrates with power, allowing them to stun a single adjacent opponent when attacking. Additionally, all allied soldier units that are originally from the House of Spades may also use these weapons to stun an adjacent unit when blocking. The stun affect is applied, even if the allied unit is defeated during combat and can take place in any order the player chooses when resolving combat. If two opposing units wielding these enchanted weapons clash, the affect is canceled out.</p> <p>Option 2 for the Kings focuses more on strategy at the Front Ranks level, rather than the King directly interacting with the opponent\u2019s army. The King would still remain a threat worth removing if the opponent is tired of dealing with the added impact of house traits. However, depending on the strategy and play style of each player, the opposing King may not always be a threat worth focusing on. Also, with the King\u2019s abilities only sharing the house traits with non-members of their house, we needed to find a bonus to members of the King\u2019s house that would already have these abilities. In most cases allowing these to apply on the defense gave us more strategic options for the defending opponent and looks to be strategically fun.</p> <p>We believe the impact the Kings will bring to the Battlefield with this option, will remain significant as well as balanced. We imagine many interesting attacker and blocker combinations that might play out, adding many more layers of strategy to the game. These gifted abilities and actions would all need to be resolved by both armies during each COMBAT phase as well. It could get messy, but we found this fun to experiment with. We expect to continue exploring this option for redesigning the Kings. NOTE: We may need to modify the Spades current trait to stun rather than deal damage on the second attack, if we go down this path.</p>"},{"location":"The%20Games/Skirmish/#beyond-the-next-version","title":"Beyond the Next Version","text":"<ul> <li>We are working on custom art for each of the cards, that will tie back to each house\u2019s theme.</li> <li>We will be expanding the lore and stories from the world of the game as well as exploring the Player\u2019s role in the game.</li> <li>We have plans to define rules for handling more than two players, both in team and \u201cfree for all\u201d formats.</li> <li>We will be building a nice dictionary of game terminologies on our website as a supplemental reference.</li> <li>We are looking at defining different rulesets, with optional rules for simplified or more advanced play.</li> <li>We are looking ahead at how the game could be designed work with different themes.

The Miezhala family dates their lineage back to the earliest times of the land, when all was under the leadership of a single individual. That ancient ruler conquered and tamed the broken land, ushering in a time of peace. The world would not stay peaceful for long however, and would all to soon be sundered apart by war once again leaving the world broken into the four kingdoms of today. But for that brief moment in time there was peace and harmony. The Miezhala family were the steady and resilient core of that ancient kingdom\u2019s rule. They were peacekeepers and healers. It was (and still is) a common tradition for all young members of the Miezhala family to choose to serve in the royal guard or join the order of healers and priests upon reaching the age of thirteen.</p> <p>One commonly known tale of the family of \u201chearts\u201d speaks of two Miezhalan brothers, who served as the first official sentinels of the kingdom and it\u2019s ruler. They were hand picked by the ruler as children to serve as his bodyguards, and were the pride of the family. It is rumored that for those years of brief peace, there was always one of the brothers by the ruler\u2019s side. The brothers were of slightly different ages, however their distinguishing features were very similar, as that of twins. It would often appear to outsiders that the very same person was tireless in his effort to protect the ruler. Sadly it was this trust and close proximity to the ruler that ultimately ushered in the war that would end all peace. One evening a brother discovered the other\u2019s heinous betrayal of their lord and kingdom. That exact act of betrayal differs from version to version of the story. However, all versions of this story agree that the tragic result was an epic conflict between the brothers that raged through the castle and lasted well into the next day. When the dust settled only one brother remained alive. To this day, it is not known which brother prevailed over the other. It is rumored that their mother\u2019s heart was broken upon learning the news. The loss of one son was unbearable and she could no longer look the other in the eye. The story claims that one morning she simply disappeared and was nowhere to be found. It is believed that she left for lands beyond, in search of ancient magic that would bring her lost son back to her. She would never return home.  Some suggest that the family crest symbolizes the two brothers standing proudly back to back keeping a vigilant eye over the kingdom. Others have suggested that the crest may also resemble the two brothers locked face to face, in a hunched struggle as they fought that fateful night. Their sacrifice and time of vigilance has inspired many songs.</p> <p>Today the country ruled by the Miezhala family might still be considered the heart and core of the land. This innermost kingdom is their inheritance from what was once ruled by the ancient lord. This country sits geographically in the middle of the other countries. For this reason, much of the trade between the other kingdoms must pass through. This land is characterized by a tall mountain range, that effectively splits the world in half. Among the tall mountain peaks are small hidden valleys where the people live. There are many such valleys that have not seen visitors from the other lands in a very long time. The great Miezhala city of Sadr famously offers sanctuary and protection to all those who seek it. All manner of people from each of the other kingdoms will commonly seek refuge in Sadr. It is located on one of the largest trading routes through the mountains.</p> <p>-- In the general background and story above I tried to explain the Hearts suit a little better. For example, how and why the symbol is shaped as it is. I also gave background and meaning to the magical ability of the Queen of Hearts in the actual game. Other attributes of the Hearts family and the cards abilities were explained and reflected in the story.  It will take a long time, but it would be fun to build stories like this out for each card or family in general and release them here for your enjoyment.  \u2013RJ</p>"},{"location":"The%20Games/Skirmish/#the-traveler","title":"The Traveler","text":"<p>For years I have traveled far and wide in a desperate search to find my way home. This is a fascinating and dangerous place in which I find myself trapped, and I fear I will never escape. I hope that these notes might someday be of aid, if you too find yourself trying to navigate this world.</p> <p>To the best of my knowledge, there are four geographic regions across the land with each one being vastly different from another. Each landscape presents different challenges and so has forged the native people into very unique cultures. Within each of these regions you will find a kingdom presided over by a royal house. I have come to know them as the quick Diamonds, brutal Clubs, vigilant Hearts and cunning Spades. </p> <p>To the far north you will find the desolate and dry lands of the House of Diamonds. In the west, among the dark forests you will find the House of Spades. To the east, where the land is wild and broken by an extensive system of rivers you will find the House of Clubs. Centrally located between these regions are the tall, cold peaks of a massive mountain range and the House of Hearts. All across the land there exists a tentative peace between these ruling houses and so trade and travel between them is not uncommon. I have been able to visit and document some of the traits of these very different lands and peoples. </p> <p>There is however, one strange commonality that I have observed across these very different cultures. As long as anyone can remember, each ruling house has always recognized the same thirteen positions of honor. Each house believes that maintaining this structure is an ancient and unquestionable duty. The method for appointing individuals to these positions is different between the kingdoms, however the fact remains that the following people exist and can be identified for each of the ruling houses. </p> <p>The King and Queen share the responsibility of governing their people along with their heir, known as the Jack. The art of espionage and intelligence is performed by the Ace and Two of each house. The Ten leads each army with the Three, Four, Five, Six, Seven, Eight and Nine serving as commanding officers.</p> <p>I have heard rumors of another such as me, who may also be trapped here. Unfortunately their identity and location has eluded me so far. Perhaps some day we may meet? \u2013The Traveler</p> <p>-- This is just an introduction to the Traveler.
